Quarto adds a number of facilities to Pandoc aimed at scientific and technical publishing, including:\n\nEmbedding code and output from Python, R, and JavaScript via integration with Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable.\nA variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hoverable citations and footnotes, callouts, and more.\nA project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like websites and books.\n\nDevelopment of Quarto is sponsored by Posit, PBC, where we previously created a similar system (R Markdown) that shared the same goals, but was targeted principally at users of the R language. The same core team works on both Quarto and R Markdown:\n\nJ.J. Allaire (@jjallaire)\nChristophe Dervieux (@cderv)\nCarlos Scheidegger (@cscheid)\nCharles Teague (@dragonstyle)\nYihui Xie (@yihui)\n\nWith Quarto, we are hoping to bring these tools to a much wider audience.\nQuarto is a registered trademark of Posit.
